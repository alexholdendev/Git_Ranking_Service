| 99 | [MoonGen](https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen) | 762 | 179 | Lua | 39 | MoonGen is a fully scriptable high-speed packet generator built on DPDK and LuaJIT. It can saturate a 10 Gbit/s connection with 64 byte packets on a single CPU core while executing user-provided Lua scripts for each packet. Multi-core support allows for even higher rates. It also features precise and accurate timestamping and rate control. | 2020-04-25T20:31:36Z |
